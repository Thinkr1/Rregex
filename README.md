## Install

1. Download the dmg from the [latest release](https://github.com/Thinkr1/Rregex/releases)
2. As I don't have a paid developer account, I cannot direcly notarize the app and you'll be presented with an alert saying it cannot be opened directly. Here are two options:

a) You can run the following command and then open the app normally: 

```sh
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app/folder/Rregex.app
```

b) You can allow the app to be opened in *System Settings > Privacy & Security* by clicking "Open Anyway" for Rregex.app:
